### About Coffee & Code Workshops

The BC Libraries’ Digital Scholarship Group hosts a series of coffee & code workshops each semester for faculty, students, and staff. The series, Coffee & Code, is open to the public. The sessions are informal workshops that provide a hands-on introduction to the application of digital methods and tools to questions and needs that may arise from data, research, or scholarship in one’s discipline or field. These sessions will provide an opportunity for exploration, learning, and discussion. Our previous offee & Code sessions include workshops on creating digital exhibits, fair use,creating online maps, textual analysis, data visualization, and more.
