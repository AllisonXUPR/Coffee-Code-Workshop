## About
### Coffee & Code Workshops

The BC Libraries’ Digital Scholarship Group hosts a series of coffee & code workshops each semester for faculty, students, and staff. The sessions are informal workshops that provide a hands-on introduction to the application of digital methods and tools to questions and needs that may arise from data, research, or scholarship in one’s discipline or field. These sessions will provide an opportunity for exploration, learning, and discussion. Our previous offee & Code sessions include workshops on creating digital exhibits, fair use,creating online maps, textual analysis, data visualization, and more. 

All of our Coffee & Code events are free and open to the public. Please visit [our website](https://ds.bc.edu/2019-spring-events/) to learn more about our workshops.
